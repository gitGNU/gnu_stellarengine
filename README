========================================================================

This is the specification for the SGE, written as a template.  For a
reference implementation, see the Pygame SGE.

To develop an implementation of SGE:

* Edit setup.py to include the name of the implementation and proper
  information about it.
* Define the values of the constants in sge/__init__.py.
* Replace the license text on top of all source code files in the "sge"
  directory with appropriate license text for the license you intend to
  use for your implementation.  Suggested license choices are the GNU
  GPL, the GNU LGPL, the Apache License, or the Expat License.
* Replace the "TODO" comments found throughout the Python files with
  actual functionality.
* Insert the name of your implementation into the
  implementation-specific information section of sge/__init__.py and
  insert all important information that is specific to your
  implementation in this section.
* Other than the implementation-specific information section, please do
  NOT modify the docstrings.
* Use the files in the "doc" directory to generate Sphinx
  documentation (e.g. with sphinx-quickstart).
* Replace this README with a file indicating the license of the
  implementation, dependencies, how to install, and a pointer to the doc
  folder for information on how to use the SGE.

To test the implementation, use the examples found in the examples
directory.

Please see also VERSION_NUMBERING, which explains how the SGE's version
numbering works.
