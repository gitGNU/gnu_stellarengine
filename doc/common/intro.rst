Introduction
============

The Stellar Game Engine (abbreviated "SGE", pronounced as "Sage") is a
free 2-D game engine.  The purpose of the SGE is to make game
development easier, which allows more rapid development by experienced
game developers and also helps less experienced game developers learn
how to develop games.

Official implementations of the SGE are `free/libre software
<http://gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html>`_, and the SGE documentation is
free/libre as well.

Even if it isn't required of you, we encourage you to release your
games' code under a free/libre software license, such as the GNU General
Public License, the Expat License, or the Apache License.  Doing so is
easy, does not negatively affect you, and is highly appreciated as a
contribution to free/libre software.
